8 october... yes! On that day, eoys will end! im soooo excited
i cant wait to go out with friends everyday after exams, i promise that the moment the math paper is done, i will literally cry tears of joy
i will go universal studios and explore singapore with cheryl and klara everyday after school and eat all the food there is.
however im still stuck studying for eoy because the harder i study now, the gladder i will be after exams
but i still have no motivation to study and always procrastinate so i realy need help
i keep saying i want to pull all nighters to study but i end up staying up watching youtube
someone help me.
