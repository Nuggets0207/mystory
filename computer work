 it was a fine day when i saw a clown in the drain
 it was bloddy and it looked like a human sized doll
 it had almost a hundred teeth and its red hair was shaped oddly, in a way it made me want to puke
 my paper boat dropped into the drain when i was playing outside under the rain
 i was devstated as the clown got my boat and i desperately wanted it back because my brother folded it for me
 it told me there was hotdogs, popcorn and cotton candy under  the drain, while drooling
 mummy told me that i am not supposed to talk to strangers but i still decided to go into the drain
 the clown bite my arm off and pulled me into the drain...
